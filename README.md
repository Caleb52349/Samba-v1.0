## Motivation
So Far i gained alot of knowledge in OOP and in Introduction to Games i learned alot about Sprites. tilesets , scripting, camera movement, prototyping and some basic Animation.  I was keen to see what i can achieve, so i created a game called Samba using Unity and made my own sprite and tileset using pisket  https://www.piskelapp.com/.
